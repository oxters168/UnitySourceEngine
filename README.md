# UnitySourceEngine
A port of Valve's Source Engine for Unity.

This project is still a work in progress. It possibly has memory issues, but I've resolved a lot of them,
so it is a lot better now at cleaning itself up. Also not all models load properly, and sometimes files are not
found in the vpk (like textures/models/etc) even though they probably are there.


Requires:
